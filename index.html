                Hi there! I'm Samruddhi Vishwasrao, a passionate web developer with a love for crafting exceptional digital experiences.
                <br>I am studying Information Technology Engineering from A C Patil College of Engineering, Kharghar.
                <br>I specialize in Full Stack Web Development using Javascript, and I'm proficient in HTML and CSS. 
            <br>I'm always eager to stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends and best practices. I've also completed certifications in these.
            <br>What excites me most about web development is the opportunity to blend creativity with functionality. <br>I'm a firm believer in the power of clean code and user-centered design. 
            I approach every project with a focus on delivering user-friendly, high-performance solutions.<br>When I'm not coding, you can find me reading. 
            I'm a firm believer in work-life balance and find that my interests outside of the digital world often inspire my creativity as a web developer.
            <br>I'm excited about the endless possibilities in the world of web development, and I'd love the opportunity to collaborate with you on your next project. 
            Let's turn your vision into reality!
